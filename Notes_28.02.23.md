# [Agenda item 1] - [Backlog final version].
We reviewed the Backlog Draft and made some necessary updates to the project terminology. As a result, we agreed to finalize the Backlog by making additional edits and adjustments.

# [Agenda item 2] - [Git Assignment].
The purpose of this agenda item was to check if everyone had successfully installed and configured Git. We discussed the status of each member's installation and configuration of Git. 
The outcome was that the team had a clearer understanding of the Git assignment and the additional points that needed to be added 
 


# Questions for the TA
We've asked for feedback on our work and some app-related questions.

# Feedback recived after the meeting
We should start doing:
- We should start coding already.
- We were suggested to divide into groups of 3 and each group does the backend and frontend part, then change every week.
