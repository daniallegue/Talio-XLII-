## Outline
In the first part of our meeting, we discussed the code of conduct, and after some suggestions, we began perfecting it and stuck with the final version of our code of conduct.After that we've asked our TA some questions about the BackLog Draft and then continued our work on the BackLog.
Ou TA answers our question:


Our assignments should all include the important information and where to submit it in their descriptions.
- Checkstyle rules should be written separately.
- If we have anything ready, we can send it to our TA and get some feedback on the go.
- The person that has the minute taker role should upload the file in the GitLab repository.
