# [Agenda item 3] - [Development Cycles].

-Set milestone to finish the basic requirements for this first development week. 


# [Agenda item 4] - [Project Architecture and mockups discussion].
- Use a service layer between REST Controller and Repository to abstract business operations; while mantaining to the MVC layer.
- We are not required to follow the mockups on the given backlog. 

# [Agenda item 4] - [Sprint 1 Discussion].
- Goal is to finish the basic requirements before the MR deadline.
- We will rotate between front-end and back-end weekly. 1 person from each section will stay for another week to make it easier to catch up. 
- Don't over-assign people to 1 unique issue. Make sure to add in the description what each member is going to work on. 
- Try to keep a log as a split team so that the team next week is able to catch up on the progress done.
