# What have people been working on
- sarah been working on the data classes and tasks
- costin on multiboarding
- pepijn on restructuring and websockets
- dani tags and helping pepijn
- yurii started working on admin but priority on websockets so helping pepijn
- yusuf working on drag and drop some improvements needed still, working on tests too 39% coverage

# Announcements
- attempt of everything websockets didn't work out, now trying to do just updates websockets the rest via REST

- only 10 days to go for final code submission so work fast

# Deadlines
Both assignments are drafts
- teamwork self reflection (personal assignment)
- product pitch video

# Structure of the video
All basic features must be presented in the video
- either all teammates present together at the same time
- separate parts by different person
    - requires editing
      - costin can edit

# What issues need to be prioritised
- basic features first
- lots of stuff dependent on pepijn's work
	- help him where possible
	- challenges with websockets and data propagation
		- websockets doesn't properly receive updates (fixed after the meeting ended)

# Upcoming work
- save client side data
	- new datastructure, serialise
	- costin picks that up
	
- sarah takes up invite links, ties into costin's task so work together also disconnecting client/server switching

- yurii, deleting boards and admin (password to see admin specific work done)

- dani working on remaining customisation, working with costin to save that locally

- yusuf working on testing continuing

- pepijn can pick the remaining basic features up

daily meeting to update each other, work together and share more work


# Testing
on a certain day, like thursday to just work on testing like two people
server side testing doable client side is difficult


# Heuristic evaluation review review
(see brightspace for the full review)
- yusuf and dani did a lot for it woohoo
- 7.3 score for the evaluation
- structure and language was not good, references missing (easy to fix)
- bad score for the prototype, not describing how the transitions and screens look like (describe them in detail, flowchart maybe)
- improve details about the experts, why chose those, and their background
- analysis is bad, not mentioning how to fix the problems (make plan/prioritise the problems)
- conclusion is mid, better prioritise
- not good prioritisation, explicitly prioritise
- make mockups of what was improved and explain


# Technology review
(see brightspace for the full review)
- client should have images
- websockets are holding us back for communication, is going to be better once it's done could be excellent after it's implemented
- same for data transfer as object mappers aren't needed for Rest

# Points from TA
- costin and yurii need to do more, more MR
- dani, costin yurii need more comments on MRs
- more communication via gitlab less via discord
- more issues taken on
- 25 minute meeting next week as no more feedback for meetings and nothing more to learn

# Closing
- people start working, fix ws today
- tomorrow another meeting
- thursday figure out the time same as wednesday
- around 50% of the backlog done, more focus on basic and higher priority
