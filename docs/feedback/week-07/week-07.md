# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Pepijn
Minute taker: Sarah

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was chairperson and minute taker.


#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: Agenda was almost added to the repository in time, did not follow the template completely (the markdown format does not help). Individual points were great!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: No notes pushed to the repository!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Very nice! Well planned, you followed the agenda point by point and covered all the topics in time, good job! Really felt like you were the chairperson.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very good

Feedback: Team took ownership of the meeting. Very good and constructive atmosphere, it is good that you went over what each person has done for each week as it helps everyone talk. Two people were not talking that much during the meeting but other than that pretty good, ideas were taken into consideration.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: No time left for demo unfortunately, but project seems to be going well so far. Not all basic features are implemented but it seems they will soon.
