# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Yusuf
Minute taker: Iurii

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was chair person and minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Agenda was added to the repository in time, did it not follow the template completely - add items and sections in the order that you will discuss them and also add the time allocated for each topic. The agenda looks a bit unorganized, there are sections without any text below them, if that is the case simply remove them or add text. Points in the agenda seemed good and constructive.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: Notes were merged with the agenda file. Good amount of notes, very clear and to the point that contain concrete agreements and actions to take. It would be nice at the end to add a little summary of the most important points.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: Good introduction and handling of the topics, however it didn't really feel like you were in charge of the meeting (mostly in the beginning, you improved it towards the end which was good). As a chairperson you should lead the discussion and address others to speak when they know better on that topic. By doing that you can also try to help people who are not very talkative during the meeting - which was the case for 2,3 people in this meeting. Other than that, topics were covered in an appropriate amount of time, and all topics were covered so good job!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Good discussions, constructive, I like how you were talking about concrete features and issues you have on them, suggesting ideas and solving problems, continue like that! Two to three people were not part of the discussion that much, try to get everyone involved.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Nice demo, again I really like the design, some stuff are working (saved on the database) some others are in progress. I believe the demo shown was not in the main branch, but I hope it will be soon :). Overall good progress, you guys are on track!
