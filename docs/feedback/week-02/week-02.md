# Week 2
## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Dani
- **Notetaker**: Costin

#### Meeting Organization

TA Instructions: Were there a chair and a minute taker?  

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker.


#### Agenda 

TA Instructions: Was it delivered in time? Did it follow the template?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Was delivered in time, similar to the template, but for next time use the template since this time Location, Date etc were missing.

#### Chair performance

TA Instructions: Did the chair ensure that all topics of the agenda were covered?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: All topics were covered, this time the dynamic of these meetings was unclear to it is fine if what you had expected didn't work out this time. Next time, make sure there is a clear structure for the meeting beforehand.

#### Time management

TA Instructions: Was there time for all topics? Were all topics covered for an appropriate amount of time?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Again, agenda was covered but the meeting had a different dynamic than expected so most of the time was spent on working on the CoC rather than discussing what will be done in the next week/Sprint. It was good that you added the time you expected some topics to take.

#### Minute taker performance

TA Instructions: Is there a good amount of notes? Do the notes contain the team agreements and the assigned people?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Action points for next week was a nice idea even though it wasn't filled in this time. Could focus more on what was said rather than what happened. But some good content was included as well.

#### Relation

TA Instructions: Was everyone involved? Did everyone contribute to the discussion topics in an equal amount? Was everyone listened to? Were everybody's ideas taken into account?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Most people were involved in the beginning, but didn't hear from 2 people at all (being online didn't help of course) but next time it would be nice to see everyone take some initiative.
