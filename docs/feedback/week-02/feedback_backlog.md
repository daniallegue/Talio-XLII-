### Backlog


### Submission

Mark: Fail

Feedback: Make sure the naming and format is correct. Should be backlog.pdf not Backlog.pdf and a pdf not .docx file (please reformat). 


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Make sure you include a description of the user stakeholder in the Stakeholders section. 
- Terminology: 
    - A bit vague "whatever the user wants" is not a good description. 
    - What does "under a specific theme" mean?
    - In your user stories you include the word "board" what does it mean?


### Epics

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Basics are good. Here are some points:
- The stories should be grouped by epic. Each epic should have a description that introduces the feature and clarifies the scope of whatâ€™s being implemented. Read about the description on the website (https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/oopp/assignments/backlog/). You could also make use of mockups to complement the description.
- List of epics needs to be consistent with lecture. Example epics (Basic, Details, Customization, Keyboard Shortcuts, Password Protection etc.).


### User Stories

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Make sure the user stories follow the required format (e.g., I as *role* want to *requirement* so I can *reason*). User stories have a clear focus on the user perspective. Really good descriptions overall, short and focused. When you add epics, make sure they are covered with a good amount of user stories and the required interactions are covered.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The size of most user stories is small and their effect is clear. When a story is covering multiple things, it might be necessary to define explicit acceptance criteria for them that help with disambiguation. Make sure to do that in your backlog. You could group the smaller user stories in one and specify the acceptance criteria. Read about this on the website as well.
