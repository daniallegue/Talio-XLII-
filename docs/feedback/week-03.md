# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Costin
Minute taker: Yurii

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient-Good

Feedback: Agenda was in the repository on time. Followed the template partially, it would be good to have assigned time for each point in the agenda to help with time management. Include more specific points in the agenda, don't base the meeting on TA feedback for assignments, talk more about them with eachother. Also, make sure that the agenda is finalized - during the meeting someone suggested to talk about something that wasn't on the agenda (add this beforehand or during the section of "Approval of the agenda").


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Note: gave feedback on this last meeting.

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Action points for next week was a nice idea even though it wasn't filled in this time. Could focus more on what was said rather than what happened. But some good content was included as well.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Covered all the topics in the agenda and it felt that you were leading the meeting. Don't be afraid to add a bit more energy to the meeting to encourage your teammembers to speak, it is good to have a friendly atmosphere (not too formal). Missed the summary at the end.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficien->Good

Feedback: In the beginning it felt a bit that the meeting was based on the feedback, but after it was nice to see you work together. Good discussions, suggestions from teammembers and good reasoning on them being approved/disapproved. One teammember did not speak as much, make sure you all speak next time, you can also ask members questions to help each other get involved. Good constructive atmosphere.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: It is a bit early to reflect on this. Progress is being made, hoping to see good things next week :)
