# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Iurii
Minute taker: Costin

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Agenda (sort of) followed the template - time was missing - and was uploaded to the repository in time. 
- It seems that it was copy pasted from last time as it said "sarah will not come today" - which was about last week (sarah was here today). It is okay to copy paste it but make sure to update it correctly.
- Considering there was 45 minutes to be filled, there were very few points on the agenda. It is helpful to allocate time for each point.
- You can make it visually nicer (there was a lot of space between "Future steps of the development" and "Summary action points" compared to the rest of the section spacing). Be more consistent on that.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback: The notes were a simple copy paste of the agenda with the addition of two bullet points at the end. Considering this was a 45 minute meeting, that is not enough notes. The two bullet points were okay, but **not** enough - did not contain any agreements/assigned people to tasks etc. I would also recommend keeping the agendas and notes in seperate folders in the repository.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Nice discussion within the group but the chair was not really part of it - as the chair you should be directing it while allowing others to speak. Generally other than the part where you ended a discussion and moved on to the next one it didn't feel that you were the chairperson. As the chairperson you set the atmosphere for the meeting so make sure to put all your energy into it. All topics were covered within the timeframe which is good.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Good meeting overall, some action points were discussed, initiative from some members yet 2-3 members were not talking that much (including the chairperson). Note, opening mobile phones during a meeting is a bit impolite.
- During discussions try to find common ground in general, it is good that you asked me (the TA) for advice when you weren't sure which approach was ideal.
- Good that you started using milestones and making issues.
- Constructive atomsphere overall.
- Good ideas/proposals e.g. "sending a message of what each person has done".


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: Team presented current state of their application, it was more of a mockup style but it was really nice to see (loved the colors and design). There is progress compared to last week, you are all more organized now and know what you are supposed to do for this week is is great. You are on a good track overall. Keep it up!
